# Where can we store some temporary files while we prep them for

# you have the ramfs/disk/etc. space for it.

# What file should we reference for packages to check/download?

[RSYNC]
# If this setting is empty, assume the webroot("dir" above) is on this host.
# If populated, assume that tarball_dir is on the given host and
# that host has rsync installed (and SSH PKI is properly set up
# to allow for automated uploading). This lets you run the checker
# on a remote box without installing python on the file host if desired.

# What remote user, if "host" is set, should we use?
# If left blank but "host" is populated, the default
# is to use the current/running local user's username.
# Remember, it is *highly* recommended to use SSH PKI.
# See https://sysadministrivia.com/notes/HOWTO:SSH_Security
# for help if desired.

# What port should we use to connect to rsync, assuming

# If blank, use port 22.
